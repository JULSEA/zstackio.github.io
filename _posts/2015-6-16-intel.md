Today we are glad to announce that Intel, the world's largest and highest valued semiconductor chip maker, becomes ZStack's partner!
Intel has been investigating many resources in the cloud computing, including help open source technology to create enterprise-ready
IaaS infrastructure. ZStack, as its leading IaaS technology brings a lot of potential for future enterprise cloud, gets much attention
from Intel and finally becomes Intel's partner in IaaS area.

Leveraging Intel's support, ZStack will continue to focus on building deployable, maintainable, and flexible IaaS software,
helping enterprises move IT infrastructure into the cloud era.
