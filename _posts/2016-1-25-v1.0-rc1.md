title: ZStack v1.0 RC1 release
author: Frank Zhang

Hello everyone, I am Frank Zhang, the architect of ZStack. Today I am happy to
announce that ZStack v1.0 is in the release cycle. In this release, ZStack
introduces following new features:

## Flat Network Provider

A new network provider, flat network provider, which provides DHCP, Userdata
services is available for users only using flat networks. Compared to the
virtual router provider, the main advantage of the new provider is you don't
need a virtual router VM to work as a DHCP server, which simplify the effort of
deploying a flat network significantly.

The flat network provider contains a distributed DHCP server system that runs a
DHCP server serving DHCP requests on the local KVM host. Compared to the
traditional DHCP system that has only one DHCP server for the whole system, the
distributed DHCP system has no single failure point, and a DHCP server down only
effects VMs on one host. Large DHCP requests originated from concurrent VMs
creation are balanced to different DHCP servers, which improves the overall
concurrency.

### Use Flat Network Provider

When you create a L3 network, do following steps when selecting network
services:

<img src="/images/1.0/2.png" class="center-img img-responsive">

1.  select provider as “Flat Network Service Provider”
2.  select service DHCP
3.  click button “Add”
4.  repeat step 2, 3 to add service Userdata

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">

<h4>You can combine flat network provider and virtual router provider</h4>

The flat network provider is mainly for flat networks which only require DHCP
service. However, you can combine it with the virtual router provider for a
mixed setup. For example, use the flat network provider for DHCP service and use
the virtual router provider for SNAT and EIP services.

</div>

## User Data

User data, complying the standard of
[cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), is enabled by the
userdata service of the flat network provider.

 

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">

<h4>Your template must install cloud-init package</h4>
To use the user data, you must install cloud-init package in the VM’s operating
system.
</div>

The userdata is implemented by ZStack’s system tag mechanism; you can use system
tag APIs to add/update/remove userdata to VMs.

### Use user data

To use use data, you need to first configure cloud-init in your VM. We suggest
you doing this once then saving the VM as a template so VMs derived from the
template will have cloud-init installed by default.

1.  yum install cloud-init or apt-get install cloud-init
2.  add following content to /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg

        datasource\_list:
