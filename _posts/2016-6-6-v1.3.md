<h2 id="actualsize"> 1. Supporting Both Virtual Size And Actual Size For Images And Volumes</h2>

ZStack uses thin-provisioning when creating VM volumes; a volume or image has two sizes, a virtual size indicating the
max capacity and a actual size indicating the capacity allocated. In previous version, users can only see the actual
size of a image and the virtual size of a volume. In this version, virtual size and actual size are all supported for images
and volumes.

For volumes, a new API `SyncVolumeSize` is added for users to get the volume's actual size at runtime.

<h2 id="cpu">2. CPU over-provisioning</h2>

In this version, a confusing term `cpu speed` is removed from the VM instance and the instance offering. The VCPU usage is only
counted by the VCPU number. Users can specify the over-provisioning ratio of VCPU by a global configuration.

    >>>UpdateGlobalConfig category=host name=cpu.overProvisioning.ratio value=20

>The default VCPU over-provisioning ratio is 10, which means one physical core(from Linux perspective) can be allocated as 10
>VCPUs.

<h2 id="startvm">3. Specifying the target host or cluster when starting a VM</h2>

In this version, users can specify the target host or cluster when starting a stopped VM.

    >>>StartVmInstance uuid=554d67a78c40475cbe4e8e0cdf6adc44 hostUuid=c2025197915944acaf0435c0c1a44f96

or

    >>>StartVmInstance uuid=554d67a78c40475cbe4e8e0cdf6adc44 clusterUuid==c2025197915944acaf0435c0c1a44f96

>This only works if the primary storage is network shared storage, for example, NFS. For local storage that
>volumes are allocated on hosts' disk, a VM cannot start on any other hosts other than the one which its root
>volume is on.

<h2 id="staticip">4. Specifying static IP when attaching a L3 network</h2>

In this version, users can specify a static IP when attaching a L3 network to a VM.

     >>>AttachL3NetworkToVm l3NetworkUuid=23e15a6acc80431fa0f1763ab45ae144 vmInstanceUuid=b7ba300853974189b7adc90f2c25e00b staticIp=192.168.1.10

<h2 id="sshport">5. Specifying SSH port when adding KVM hosts or SFTP backup storage</h2>

In this version, users can specify the SSH port that is used by Ansible when adding a KVM host or a SFTP backup storage.

<h2 id="log">6. Log collection tool</h2>

In this version, a tool archiving various logs is added for users reporting bugs to ZStack community. The tool is implemented as
a `zstack-ctl` command and is easy to use.

<h2 id="fusionstor">6. Supporting fusionstor as primary and backup storage</h2>

In this version, HuaYunWangJi's commercial storage system *fusionstor* is supported as primary storage and backup storage. It
works just like Ceph, users can add it through ZStack's UI easily;
