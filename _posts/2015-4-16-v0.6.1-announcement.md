Hello everyone, I am Frank Zhang, the architect of ZStack. Today I am happy to announce that ZStack v0.6.1 is released.
In this version, we fixed a bug that may cause the failure of adding host in the certain circumstance. The installation
script has been updated to the latest version.

I hope you enjoy the project!
