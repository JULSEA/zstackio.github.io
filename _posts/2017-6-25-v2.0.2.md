Hello everyone, I am Yongkang You, the COO of ZStack. Today I am happy to announce that ZStack v2.0.2 is released. 

We did not update zstack.org for a long time, because we were continuing building much more powerful ZStack.
We did a lot of things in the past 1 year, e.g. releasing ZStack Enterprise with multiple languages, launching new Chinese website http://www.zstack.io and also adding more network services like VxLAN, load balance and IP-SEC. 

We got series A round funding from Alibaba Cloud and grew up with a bigger team. 

ZStack has built a firmed community in China. Hundreds of private clouds are using ZStack.
