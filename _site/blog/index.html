node can manage hundreds of thousands of physical servers, millions of virtual machines, and handle tens of thousands of concurrent tasks.</em></p>

          <p>Three years ago, when I was working on another IaaS software, my friend joked: "you guys are making a product
killing IT administrators' job." I did think so then. In my opinion, enterprises could
be liberated from boring tasks of maintaining old-fashion datacenters, by adopting IaaS technology and moving
every underlying infrastructure to software-defined datacenter. Thereby, manpower is transferred to more revenue-driven work such as
applications that drive companies' core business, and leaves only a few in operations team in charge of running the entire infrastructure.
However, three years later, IaaS software has not impacted the administrators' job. Ironically, it has created a lot of new jobs.
Nowadays, businesses adopting private clouds based on IaaS need not only an operations team to daily maintain their
infrastructure, but also a dev team or a consultant company to maintain the IaaS software itself. This may be good for
engineers, as people with such skills are easier to get good pay (searching OpenStack on online hiring websites
will prove this), but sad for developers like me who are supposed to create something to relieve life.</p>

          <p><em>Lots of tasks in IaaS software need to execute in sequence; for example, when a task of starting a virtual machine is running,
a stopping task of the same virtual machine must wait for the previous starting task to finish. On the other side,
some tasks should be able to run in parallel; for example, 20 tasks of creating virtual machines on the same host can run simultaneously.
Synchronization and fine-grained parallelization in a distributed system are not easy and usually require a distributed coordination software.
Rising to the challenge, ZStack offers a lock-free architecture built on queues, allowing tasks to control their parallelism
level easily from 1(synchronized) to N(parallel).</em></p>

          <p><em>Current IaaS software are more like cloud controller software that still lack lots of features to be complete cloud solutions. As an evolving
technology, predicting what features will make up a complete solution is hard, so an IaaS software cannot build all features it will
need from the very beginning. Given those facts, the architecture of an IaaS software must be able to keep core orchestration stable from adding new features.
ZStack, with a versatile plugin system, allows features to be implemented as plugins(both in-process or out-of-process)
which can not only extend ZStack's functionality, but also hook into business logic to change default behaviours.</em></p>

complete specification defining category, form, and usage of tags. Besides users, plugins can create their tags too,

introduce new features without changing ZStack's database schema, diminishing the need for database migration in software upgrade.</em></p>

an IaaS software must provide a mechanism that can roll back prior executed steps. With a workflow engine, every step in ZStack
wrapped in individual flow can be rolled back on error. Besides, key execution paths can be configured by assembling workflows
in configuration files, which decouples the architecture further.</em></p>

          <p><em>Resources in a cloud have relations to each other. An operation to one resource may usually set off a chain
effect to others; for example, when deleting a cluster, it makes sense to delete all hosts belonging to that
cluster and to stop all VMs running on those hosts. Traditional IaaS software either hard code chain effects
or simply deny those operations, for example, prohibiting users from deleting a cluster that has VM running. ZStack offers
a cascade framework that can spread an operation from one resource to all related resources. Resources can choose to join
the cascade framework by implementing a simple extension point, which decouples the framework from resources' business logic.</em></p>

finding the VM that has EIP(16.16.16.16) from 10,000 VMs. Most IaaS software solves this problem by ad-hoc query logic in APIs.
ZStack, instead of ad-hoc, equips with a framework that can automatically generate queries for every field of every resource,
and join queries that span multiple resources, helping users to manage enormous resources in the cloud.</em></p>

With massive devices, installing and upgrading agents become huge challenges, so most IaaS software leave this problem
to customers or distribution vendors, which leads to fragile solutions because of lacking support from IaaS software themselves.
ZStack took this problem into account in the very beginning, tried out Puppet, Salt, and Ansible successively,
and finally integrated with Ansible seamlessly and transparently. All ZStack agents are automatically deployed, configured,
and upgraded by Ansible; users may not even notice their existences.</em></p>
