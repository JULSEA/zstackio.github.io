## Getting Started With Quick Installation

Once you have installed ZStack on a Linux machine following instructions in [Quick Installation](../installation/index.html),
you immediately get everything ready to create your first cloud.

To access the web UI, open your browser with URL:

      http://ip_of_machine_installing_zstack:5000
      
To use command line tool, type `zstack-cli` on the machine that ZStack is installed:

      root@ubuntu1404:~# zstack-cli
      
Now your ZStack environment is ready, please visit [Tutorials](../tutorials) to create your first cloud deployment
using either web UI or command line tool, or check out [User Manual](http://zstackdoc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for a full reference.
We also suggest you read [Getting Started With Manual Installation](getstart-manual.html) for useful `zstack-ctl` commands
that can configure and control ZStack management node.
